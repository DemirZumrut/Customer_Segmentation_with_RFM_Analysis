# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

Business Problem:
The UK-based retail company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments.

RFM analysis will be used for segmentation.

The dataset named Online Retail II includes online sales transactions of a UK-based retail company between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011. The company's product catalog includes souvenirs and it is known that most of its customers are wholesalers.

InvoiceNo: Invoice Number (If this code starts with C, it means that the transaction has been cancelled) <bv>
StockCode: Product code (unique for each product)
Description: Product name
Quantity: Number of products (How many of the products on the invoices were sold)
InvoiceDate: Invoice date
UnitPrice: Invoice price
CustomerID: Unique customer number
country: country name
